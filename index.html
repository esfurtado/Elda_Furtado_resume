    <p class="lead">Hello World! My name is Elda, a Portuguese junior Software Engineer living in London UK.</p>
    <p>I have been an Audiologist for at least a decade, mostly working for the NHS.
        Although healthcare can be rewarding I have found myself delving into technology, data science and programming for the past couple of years, until I decided it was time to try a new career path.
        Technology plays a huge part in improving people's healthcare outcomes and wellbeing in general and I want to play my part in that drive.</p>
    <p>Apart from career goals I'd say my main motivators for getting up in the morning would be my cats, great food (I am Portuguese after all) and good music.</p><br>
